# Unit-1-Project

This is my Unit 1 Project of Bloomtech where I analyze and made inferences about energy usage through specific timeframes in the US by using data provided via Kaggle.
In this project I mainly wanted to test the hypothesis that there may be a correlation about the time of year and how much energy is used. While it was a relatively big set of data, I was able to feature engineer some new columns that made my findings much easier to visualize. It allowed me to sort it by the Hour, Day, Week, and even Year. Using this, I then put them into dataframes and used it in a regression model which was a heavy influence on my hypothesis.

The libraries used in this project include Pandas and Numpy, the usual suspects, as well as Matplotlib and Seaborn which allowed me to make my graphs for better 
visualizations, as well as Scipy Stats which enabled me to conduct t-tests and such.
